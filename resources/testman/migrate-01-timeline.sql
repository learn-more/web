-- Testman migration 01: put every run on master's timeline
--
-- One ALTER per table, because each of these changes rebuilds the whole table anyway and
-- doing them separately would rebuild it three times. On MyISAM that rebuild holds a
-- table-level write lock and submitting builders block until it finishes, so run this in
-- a maintenance window and measure first to know how long it has to be:
--
--   SELECT table_name, engine, table_rows,
--          ROUND(data_length /1024/1024) AS data_mb,
--          ROUND(index_length/1024/1024) AS index_mb
--   FROM information_schema.tables
--   WHERE table_schema = 'testman'
--   ORDER BY data_length DESC;
--
-- winetest_logs is deliberately left alone. It is by far the largest table (one mediumblob
-- per suite per run) and is only ever read by primary key, so converting it would dominate
-- the window without buying anything.
--
--
-- InnoDB
-- ------
-- MyISAM means table-level write locks, so a builder submitting results blocks every
-- reader for the duration, and no transactions, so a half-submitted run cannot be rolled
-- back. gitinfo has been InnoDB all along.
--
--
-- Indexes
-- -------
-- ix_runs_ts        every search filters finished = 1 and then orders and pages by id;
--                   the timestamp in the middle makes the date filter an index range.
-- ix_runs_src_plat  covers "this builder on this platform, newest first", which is what
--                   the landing view and the suite history page ask for.
-- ix_runs_base      the revision range, which is now a numeric compare on base_order.
-- ix_runs_base_rev  the hash search also matches what a run was built on top of, so that
--                   typing a master commit finds the pull request builds based on it.
--                   Without this that half of the OR cannot use an index at all.
-- ix_runs_pr        every run of one pull request, across all builders.
--
-- KEY (revision) already serves the other half of that search, the LIKE 'abc1234%' prefix
-- match at the full 40 chars.
--
--
-- Anchor columns
-- --------------
-- A run's identity (the exact commit it built) and its position on master's timeline (what
-- it was built against) are not the same thing. For a master build they coincide; for a
-- build of refs/pull/N/merge they do not, and that hash is not in gitinfo and never will
-- be - which is why searching for such a run used to fail outright and a revision range
-- used to omit it silently.
--
-- revision       unchanged: the exact hash that was built.
-- base_revision  the master commit it was built on top of. Same as revision for a master
--                build, the merge base for a PR build, NULL when only the approximate
--                position is known.
-- base_order     master_revisions.id of base_revision. The sortable, rangeable axis, and
--                the only column timeline queries touch.
-- base_exact     0 when base_order was guessed from the run's clock rather than resolved.
-- ref            what the builder checked out, verbatim: "refs/heads/master",
--                "refs/pull/9453/merge", "refs/pull/9453/head". Not normalised, because
--                /merge (the pull request merged into master) and /head (the pull request
--                branch alone) are different things with differently computed bases.
-- pr_number      parsed out of ref, so "every run for PR N" is one indexed query.
--
-- Old SVN runs keep NULL in all of these: they predate git and gitinfo has no ordinal for
-- them. They stay reachable by date.
--
-- Fill these in for existing runs with backfill-run-anchors.php afterwards.
